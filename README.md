# GitHub-User-Activity

very useful project for learning the dealing with APIs, Cli arguments, JSON and show data without using any external libraries.

You can learn more about the GitHub API here.

- [REST API endpoints for events](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/events?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
- [GitHub event types](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/github-event-types?apiVersion=2022-11-28#event-object-common-properties)

## TODOs

- [x] Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid usernames or API failures.
- [ ] filtering the activity by event type, displaying the activity in a more structured format
- [ ] caching the fetched data to improve performance.
- [ ] explore other endpoints of the GitHub API to fetch additional information about the user or their repositories.
- [ ] use classes to structure the code better.
